# Scope and purpose

The **traits** working group is dedicated to improving the trait
system implementation in rustc. This working group is a collaboration
between the [lang team] and the compiler team. We have a number of inter-related
goals:

- designing new trait-related language features;
- documenting and specifying the semantics of traits in Rust today; and,
- improving the trait solver implementation in rustc.

[lang team]: https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/

A big part of this work is transitioning the compiler to use a
[Chalk-style] solver, but along the way we hope to make targeted fixes
to the existing solver where needed.
