## Performance logs

# 2024-05-27 Triage Log

A relatively quiet week, with few large changes, the largest driven by further
increasing the scope of unsafe precondition checking.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [1d0e4afd..a59072ec](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1d0e4afd4cac09078e12a232508c3e9f8d42535d&end=a59072ec4fb6824213df5e9de8cae4812fd4fe97&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

#### Regressions

Rewrite native thread-local storage [#116123](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116123) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ed172dbbaf1c702b99da54554b33b3fe65021da9&end=9c8a58fdb895204cb19eeb97472a78caa1c57c19&stat=instructions:u)

Regressions deemed worth the overall change's contents (see
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116123#issuecomment-2009408868). The TLS
state is now stored in a single thread-local object rather than two, which
should decrease costs of addressing it in general (modulo LLVM difficulties).

Likely related to fixing an issue around LLD discovery, see
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125463#issuecomment-2129069901. Bugfix
warrants spending a bit more time.

Seems to be limited primarily to one scenario in regex, with lots of new
metadata decoding. Asked for follow-up by PR author.

Regressions are partially mitigated by #125410 (see earlier in the report).
Further follow-up is expected to investigate closing remaining gap
(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/124417#issuecomment-2126056523).

Regressions are likely to be inliner noise, not meaningful changes.

Seems plausible that the regression is due to #124389 (since it affected derive
macros). But also seems not worth further investigation given it's a secondary
benchmark and minimal impact. Marked as triaged.

Regressions are likely expected as we're lowering more code that's late-removed.
