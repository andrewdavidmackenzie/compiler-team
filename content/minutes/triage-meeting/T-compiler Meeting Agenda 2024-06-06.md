## Performance logs

A quiet week; we did have one quite serious regression (#115105, "enable
DestinationPropagation by default"), but it was shortly reverted (#125794).
The only other PR identified as potentially problematic was rollup
[PR #125824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125824), but even
that is relatively limited in its effect.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* all 12 of the regressing primary benchmarks are diesel-1.4.8 (in a variety of configurations).
* problem was isolated to PR #125089 (improve diagnostic output of non_local_definitions lint)
* Urgau notes: "The lint triggers nearly 150 times in the version of diesel used by rustc-perf, so the benchmark has become a bit a linting machinery benchmark"
* cc rustc-perf#1819
* marked as triaged.

* helloworld is sole primary regression.
* marked as triaged (my own opinion is that helloworld is a useful canary when it regresses by a more significant amount than this)
* (also the 30-day history shows the story for helloworld to be quite a bit more complicated than what is presented by the effects of this single PR, there are lots of spikes mixed in there)
