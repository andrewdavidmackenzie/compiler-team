## Performance logs

> [triage logs 2024-03-11](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2024-03-11.md)

A mixed week, with a vast number of improvements (in large part due to PR
#122010, which undoes a prior regression; PR #120985, a host LLVM update).
But also three admittedly small-ish regressions which seemed unanticipated and
were still large enough that I did not feel comfortable rubber-stamping them
with a perf-regression-triaged marking.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [41d97c8a..e919669d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=41d97c8a5dea2731b0e56fe97cd7cb79e21cff79&end=e919669d42dfb8950866d4cb268c5359eb3f7c54&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

* primary regressions are all to serde and cranelift codegen for various profiles of incr-patched:println.
* the cycles measurement didn't observe any change at all, but that could be due to the difference being swamped by overall variance
* the [perf diff](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=c69fda7dc664e62f8920a02a4e55d6207b212c24&benchmark=serde-1.0.136-check&scenario=incr-patched%3A+println&base_commit=cd81f5b27ee00b49d413db50b5e6af871cebcf23&sort_idx=-11) highlights that the query `live_symbols_and_ignored_derived_traits` is the source of the perf regression, which is consistent with the idea that this lint has become more expensive since that's where we see the call to the newly-added `solve_rest_impl_items` (a worklist algorithm from the PR).
* leaving a note for the author about this; not marking as triaged.

* all 12 primary improvements are to diesel
* this is because of PR #122107, which made the `non_local_definitions` lint allow-by-default
* this effectively had the reverse effect of PR #120393 (which added the aforementioned lint and caused regressions to 12 variations of diesel).

* primary regressions are to cargo opt-full (1.76%), cargo debug-incr-patched:println (0.40%), libc doc-full (0.50%), hyper doc-full (0.19%).
* the regression to cargo opt-full [was anticipated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120268#issuecomment-1943896894) by rust-timer runs during development; but other follow-up rust-timer runs did not always include the same regression.
* the PR itself notes that there are known performance problems in LLVM with unreachable branches (see e.g. [llvm#78578](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/78578)). It is not clear to me whether the above regressions are related to that.

* sole primary regression is to image opt-full
* improvements obviously outweigh the regressions
* ... but oh, there is also a bootstrap regression that may be of concern: "Bootstrap: 648.483s -> 652.903s (0.68%)"
* kobzol has hypothesized that PR #122099 may be the cause of the bootstrap regression.
* after some discussion on the rollup PR, decided to mark as triaged; the author
  may well choose to do some followup, but we will not hound them about it. :)
