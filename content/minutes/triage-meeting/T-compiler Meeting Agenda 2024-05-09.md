## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2024-05-07](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/6774c877ace0a2d9138b2b06ef0aabf6c2317a43/triage/2024-05-06.md)

Largely uneventful week; the most notable shifts were considered false-alarms
that arose from changes related to cfg-checking (either cargo enabling it, or
adding cfg's like `rustfmt` to the "well-known cfgs list").

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [c65b2dc9..69f53f5e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=c65b2dc935c27c0c8c3997c6e8d8894718a2cb1a&end=69f53f5e5583381267298ac182eb02c7f1b5c1cd&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

* all primary regressions are to doc-full scenarios, and the 1.2% is to helloworld.
* not worth teasing apart a rollup PR.
* marking as triaged.

* syn (mostly check builds, but also a debug incr-unchanged and opt incr-unchanged) had regressions ranging from 7.24% all the way up to 19.11%.
* The most plausible hypothesis is that this is due to an explosion in the number of warnings emitted for this benchmark. (The number of warnings went from ~200 up to 1800, according to Urgau's analysis).
* This means the code ends up becoming, at least in part, a benchmark of the lint machinery, regardless of whether that is our intent or not.
* see also [rustc-perf#1819](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1819) "Consider passing -Awarnings (or similar) to avoid false alarms from lint *reporting*"
* marking as triaged.

* all regressions were to syn, to various incr-unchanged and incr-patched:println scenarios.
* current hypothesis is that this is due to PR #124742, which adds `rustfmt` to the well-known cfgs list.
* that hypothesis implies that this is a (mostly-)false alarm, much like #124684.

#### Improvements

Rollup of 10 pull requests [#124646](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/124646) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=79734f1db8dbe322192dea32c0f6b80ab14c4c1d&end=561b5dea1e7e5c21f0fb550ca579229ceb878297&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)           | -1.0% | [-2.8%, -0.2%] | 24    |

* the bulk of the improvements are to variations of html5ever and serde_derive.
* skimming over the rollup list, I cannot identify an immediate root cause for improvement
* but for now will treat it like a happy accident

Some hir cleanups [#124401](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/124401) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d2d24e395a1e4fcee62ca17bf4cbddb1f903af97&end=09cd00fea4aecaa6707f122d7e143196b8a12ee2&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)           | -0.1% | [-0.2%, -0.1%] | 3     |

* all improvements are to variations of typenum
* the hir cleanups in question are largely to store `AnonConst` (e.g. for array lengths) in the HIR arena, and then move the ConstArg span over to AnonConst span instead.
* inspection of typenum didn't show any particular cases that seemed like the would stress `AnonConst`; maybe the benefit comes more from the places where we now pass a span by value instead of passing a pointer to it.

#### Mixed

Account for immutably borrowed locals in MIR copy-prop and GVN [#123602](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/123602) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=befabbc9e5f6e82e659f9f52040ee0dd40593d8a&end=d2d24e395a1e4fcee62ca17bf4cbddb1f903af97&stat=instructions:u)

* html5ever opt-full regressed by 0.92%; libc in various incremental scenarios regressed by 0.30% to 0.39%.
* the libc changes were anticipated in the perf build prior to merge; html5ever opt-full was not predicted there.
* pnkfelix hypothesizes that this just reflects some extra-work from the compiler attempting to do the copy-propagation and global-value-numbering mir-optimizations on a larger set of immutably-borrowed locals, and is acceptable given the expected benefits.
* marking as triaged
